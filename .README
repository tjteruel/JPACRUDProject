### Lessons Learned

I learned about the importance of attention to detail. There are many moving parts that all need
to be in sync. If anything is off, the JSPs cannot communicate with one another. This was also my first
in depth dive into using Boostrap, HTML, and CSS. Mastering webpage design will ensure that I can
accurately and effectively display the information that I need to the user.
